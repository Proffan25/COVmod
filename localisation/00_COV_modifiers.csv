the_second_white_terror_desc;Following the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo and the enthronement of Louis XVIII as king of France after the Hundred Days, suspected sympathizers of the French Revolution (including former Jacobins), Republicans, Bonapartists and, to a minor degree, Protestants, suffered persecution. The Second White Terror focused mainly on the purging of a civilian administration which had almost completely turned against the Bourbon monarchy. The remnants of the Napoleonic army were disbanded after the Battle of Waterloo and its senior officers cashiered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
